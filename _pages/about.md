About me
======
I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the [University of Southern California](http://www.usc.edu) (USC). I'm honored to work under the guidance of Prof. [Emilio Ferrara](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name) at the USC [Information Sciences Institute](http://www.isi.edu). I'm also working with Prof. [Mohammad Soleymani](https://people.ict.usc.edu/~soleymani/) at the USC [Institute for Creative Technologies](https://ict.usc.edu).

Before joining USC, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Communication Engineering from [Wuhan University of Technology](http://english.whut.edu.cn), under the guidance of Dr. Daping He.

I'm interested in **computational social science**, especially in leveraging **multimodal** techniques to detect and predict human behaviors on social media. Moving forward, I envision incorporating data from social media, economic metrics, and demographic information to delve deeper into the underlying factors contributing to the popularity of hot social issues and events.
