I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the [University of Southern California] ('http://www.usc.edu') (USC). I'm honored to work under the guidance of Prof. [Emilio Ferrara] ('http://www.emilio.ferrara.name') at the USC [Information Sciences Institute] ('http://www.isi.edu'). I'm also working with Prof. [Mohammad Soleymani] ('https://people.ict.usc.edu/~soleymani/') at the USC [Institute for Creative Technologies] ('https://ict.usc.edu').

Prior to joining USC, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Communication Engineering from [Wuhan University of Technology] ('http://english.whut.edu.cn'). 

I'm interested in **computational social science**, especially in leveraging **multimodal** techniques to detect and predict human behaviors on social media. Moving forward, I envision incorporating data from social media, economic metrics, and demographic information to delve deeper into the underlying factors contributing to the popularity of hot social issues and events.
