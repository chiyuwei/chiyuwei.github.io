About me
======
I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at the [Thomas Lord Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.usc.edu), University of Southern California ([USC Viterbi](https://viterbischool.usc.edu)). I'm honored to work under the guidance of Prof. [Emilio Ferrara](http://www.emilio.ferrara.name) at the USC [Information Sciences Institute](http://www.isi.edu). I'm also working with Prof. [Mohammad Soleymani](https://people.ict.usc.edu/~soleymani/) at the USC [Institute for Creative Technologies](https://ict.usc.edu).

Before joining USC, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Communication Engineering from [Wuhan University of Technology](http://english.whut.edu.cn) under the guidance of Dr. Daping He.

I am deeply interested in **computational social science**, particularly in utilizing **multimodal** techniques to analyze and forecast human behaviors on social media platforms. The potential positive impact of **Large Language Models** in the realm of social science also piques my interest. Looking ahead, I plan to integrate data from social media, economic indicators, and demographic metrics to gain a deeper understanding of the core factors driving the popularity of pressing social topics and events.

I'm seeking Ph.D. opportunities in Computer Science, Information Science, and related fields, with a focus on Computational Social Science. If my research aligns with your interests, please contact me at chiyuwei@usc.edu.
